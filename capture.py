# Only runs on a Raspberry Pi with the camera module connected via CSI.

    Uses manual focus at a fixed LensPosition suited to the top-down rig.
    Manual focus is preferred over continuous AF for repeatability — once
    LENS_POSITION is tuned for your working distance it never needs to change
    unless the camera height is adjusted.

        output_path: Where to save the JPEG. Defaults to a timestamped file
